# BrIW v0.1

An app to take your drink rounds.

## Setting up and running

Requires python3. Install with homebrew `brew install python` or your favourite package manager.

Tests use the unittest testing library. Install this with pip using `pip3 install unittest`.

Data files for people, drinks, and rounds are csv files in data/. 

To run: 

- from command line: in the root directory, run `python3 -m src.brIW1`
- otherwise: the main script is src/brIW.py so run this in your IDE of choice
