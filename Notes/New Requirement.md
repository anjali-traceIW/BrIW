data management

Analytics focus. Ties bank more into a game. Leaderboards would be step one towards analytics. 

leaderboards first step. Trending, how is a player's overall rank being affected by a current game? Over all time? What games are going on? Search by people present. View accounts and contents. 

View this certain game - players involved - account balances (anything the bank owns). e.g., name balance

Two parts/pages to front end

Analytics to be discussed later. Come up with some potential stats. After leaderboards and admin screens.

Landing page navigation to one of the three above pages.

If a player leaves, their balance does not contribute to their overall networth. Only players who have completed a game will have their final game balance added to their overall score.

a current game data view: 

how is this game affecting thier long term leaderboard position? Are they doing better or worse than they are usually. 

Want to include property value in calculation of their current game net worth. Ask land registruy what they have decided for the value of a property.
